<P>
To use SST on an IBM Personal Computer (or compatible),
it helps to know a little about the disk operating system (DOS) used on
the IBM PC. The best reference is your DOS manual (supplied with your
computer), but we will review a few simple commands here. SST requires
version 2.0 or higher of PC-DOS or MS-DOS.
<P>
<H2><A  NAME="DiskDrive">Disk drives</A></H2>
Your PC has one or more floppy disk drives and possibly a fixed (or
<DFN>hard</DFN>) disk to store programs and data. The advantage of a hard disk
is that it can store large amounts of data which can be accessed
relatively quickly. SST, however, can be run successfully on a PC with
only a single floppy disk drive (see the section in Chapter 2, "Tips on
using SST without a hard disk").
<P>
<H2><A  NAME="DefDrive">Default drive</A></H2>
The "default drive" is where DOS expects to find your programs and
data. To remind you which drive is currently the default, the DOS
prompt is preceded by a letter which refers to it. A and B
refer to floppy disk drives, while C refers to the hard disk (if
one is installed). In the <CITE>User's Guide</CITE> all examples of DOS
commands are preceded by a default drive designation (typically
<CODE>A&#62;</CODE>) to avoid confusion with SST commands.
<P>
<H2><A  NAME="ChgDefDrive">Changing the default drive</A></H2>
To change the default drive, type the desired drive letter followed by
a carriage return. DOS will respond with a prompt that gives the
desired drive as the default.
<P>
<H2><A  NAME="Dir">Directories</A></H2>
To obtain a listing of the files on the default drive (a <DFN>directory</DFN>),
give the command:
<P>
<PRE>
A&#62;dir
</PRE>
<P>
To a listing of the files on another drive, type:
<P>
<PRE>
A&#62;dir a:
</PRE>
<P>
to see, for example, which files are on the A disk. You could, of course,
first make A the default drive and then give the previous command, but
this is more cumbersome. This example illustrates a general feature of
DOS. Unless you specify otherwise, DOS assumes that it will be dealing
with the default drive. You can perform most operations without changing
the default drive by specifing another drive letter at the appropriate
spot.
<P>
<H2><A  NAME="SpecFile">Specifying a filename</A></H2>
Most DOS commands require you to specify one or more filenames.
Valid filenames are composed of up to eight characters and are optionally
followed by an extension of up to three characters. The filename and
extension are separated by a period. Some examples of DOS filenames are:
<P>
<PRE>
sst.exe
demo.cmd
junk
</PRE>
<P>
Extensions can be used to remind you what the file contains.  SST uses the
extension <SAMP>`.cmd'</SAMP> for files of SST commands and the extension <SAMP>`.sav'</SAMP>
for SST system files.
<P>
<H2><A  NAME="CopyFile">Copying files</A></H2>
Frequently you will want to make a copy of a file.
To copy a file (named <CODE>oldfile</CODE>) to a new file named <CODE>newfile</CODE>,
enter:
<P>
<PRE>
A&#62;copy oldfile newfile
</PRE>
<P>
The file <CODE>newfile</CODE> will have exactly the same contents as the file
<CODE>oldfile</CODE>. As always, DOS assumes <CODE>oldfile</CODE> is on the default
drive and also places <CODE>newfile</CODE> on the default drive.  The syntax of DOS
commands when two filenames are required is usually "from to", i.e. the
first filename is the source (or "from") file and the second is the
destination (or "to") file.
<P>
To copy a file from one disk to another, it is only necessary to precede
the filename by a drive designation. If you are copying files between
disks, then the copy can have the same filename as the original. In fact,
if you do not supply a filename for the destination, DOS assumes that you
want to use the same filename as the source. For example, if B is the
default drive, the following command makes a copy of the file <CODE>oldfile</CODE>
from the A disk on the B disk with the same name:
<P>
<PRE>
B&#62;copy a:oldfile
</PRE>
<P>
On the other hand, if <CODE>oldfile</CODE> is on B (the default drive) and you
would like a copy on the A disk, type:
<P>
<PRE>
A&#62;copy oldfile a:
</PRE>
<P>
(It is not necessary to precede <CODE>oldfile</CODE> with a drive designation
since it is on the default drive.)  If there is already a file named
<CODE>oldfile</CODE> on A (the destination drive), it will be overwritten.
<P>
<H2><A  NAME="AbbrevFile">Abbreviating filenames in DOS</A></H2>
DOS allows you to use a simple scheme of <DFN>wild cards</DFN> to refer to
multiple filenames without having to type out the entire list of filenames
that you want. There are two wild cards, the question mark and the
asterisk. A question mark matches any character while an asterisk matches
any string of characters. For example, <SAMP>`s?t'</SAMP> matches <SAMP>`sat'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`sst'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`st'</SAMP>. Similarly, <SAMP>`s*t'</SAMP> would match each of the
previous names as well as <SAMP>`short'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`s123.45t'</SAMP>. The abbreviation
<SAMP>`*.sav'</SAMP> would match any filename with the extension <SAMP>`.sav'</SAMP> (i.e.,
any SST system file), while <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> (or, equivalently, <SAMP>`*.*'</SAMP>) would
match any filename.
<P>
To obtain a listing of all the files on the A drive with the extension
<SAMP>`.sav'</SAMP>, type:
<P>
<PRE>
B&#62;dir a:*.cmd
</PRE>
<P>
To copy all files from A to B, you could use the command:
<P>
<PRE>
C&#62;copy a:*.* b:
</PRE>
<P>
SST uses a similar scheme of wild cards to abbreviate variable names.
<P>
<H2><A  NAME="ListFile">Listing the contents of a file on the monitor</A></H2>
To display the contents of a text file on the monitor, you can use the
DOS type command which has the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>
A&#62;type filename
</PRE>
<P>
As always, if the filename is not preceded by a drive specification,
DOS assumes the file is on the default drive. To type a file on the A
drive, use instead:
<P>
<PRE>
B&#62;type a:filename
</PRE>
<P>
Not all files in DOS are textfiles. Files with the extension <SAMP>`.exe'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`.com'</SAMP> are executable programs stored in a binary format which
cannot be typed.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="StopScroll">To stop scrolling output on the screen</A></H2>
If you attempt to type a large file, it is apt to <DFN>scroll</DFN> down the
screen faster than you are able to read it. To stop scrolling, press
the &#60;Ctrl&#62; and the &#60;Scroll Lock&#62; keys simultaneously. To restart
output, press the &#60;Ctrl&#62; and &#60;Scroll Lock&#62; keys again.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="PrtScr">To print what is on the screen</A></H2>
If you have a printer connected to your computer and you would like a
"hard" copy of what is currently on the screen, depress the &#60;shift arrow&#62;
and &#60;PrtSc&#62; keys simultaneously, and DOS will send a copy of what is on the
screen to your printer.  If you want to obtain a printed copy of the rest
of your computer session, depress the &#60;Ctrl&#62; and &#60;PrtSc&#62; keys
simultaneously.  Further output will be sent to the printer as it appears
on the screen. To stop printing depress these keys again.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SubDir">Subdirectories</A></H2>
DOS allows you to organize disks into subdirectories--groupings of
files in a tree structure. For most purposes a subdirectory on a
disk is used as if it were a separate disk.
<P>
To create a subdirectory named <CODE>sst</CODE>, type:
<P>
<PRE>
C&#62;mkdir sst
</PRE>
<P>
The subdirectory <CODE>sst</CODE> now exists. There are two ways to access
files in the subdirectory. First, you can make the subdirectory the
<DFN>default</DFN> directory in the same way that you make a disk drive the
default drive. This is done by changing directories:
<P>
<PRE>
C&#62;cd sst
</PRE>
<P>
You are now located within the sst subdirectory. To obtain a listing
of files in the sst subdirectory, give the command:
<P>
<PRE>
C&#62;dir
</PRE>
<P>
Unless you specify otherwise, DOS assumes that you only want a listing
of files in the default subdirectory--which is whatever subdirectory
you happen to be located in at the time you issue a command. To return
to the main (or <DFN>root</DFN>) directory, give the command:
<P>
<PRE>
C&#62;cd \
</PRE>
<P>
The backslash (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>) is DOS's symbol for the top directory.
<P>
The other way to access files in a subdirectory is to provide DOS
with a <DFN>path</DFN> telling it how to find the file you are interested in.
If you are in the root directory and you would like to see the contents
of a file in the <CODE>sst</CODE> subdirectory, try:
<P>
<PRE>
C&#62;type sst\filename
</PRE>
<P>
Thus, it is not necessary to change directories to access a file in
another directory.
<P>
DOS allows you to create subdirectories in subdirectories so directory
structures can become rather complicated. We do not recommend this
practice if you are a newcomer to DOS. For the purposes of this manual
we will assume that you do not have subdirectories to subdirectories.
<P>
Specifying pathnames can become rather tedious and DOS provides a
facility for specifying which directories are to be searched for
programs with the path command. If you type:
<P>
<PRE>
C&#62;path \;\sst
</PRE>
<P>
DOS will search the root directory (<CODE>\</CODE>) and the sst subdirectory
(<CODE>\sst</CODE>) when it looks for programs to execute. With the above path
command, it is possible to execute sst, for example, without being located
in the sst subdirectory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="Autoexec">The AUTOEXEC.BAT file</A></H2>
Every time you start your computer, DOS looks for a file called
<CODE>autoexec.bat</CODE> on the default drive and, if it finds this file,
it executes the commands
there.
